# OldEcosiaTheme

Userscript that reverts the new Ecosia design

Update: the script now works reliably and has most of the elements of the old design. If you're missing anything, please let me know by opening an issue!


Works 100% on the search page, the home page only has minor changes (font, button design, color scheme)


# Known Bugs
* Logo on homepage (can't manage to correctly alter the size of the svg, please get in touch if you want to help)
* Button design of less relevant buttons (for example the next page button, or the dropdown in settings)

I think the script is good enough even though it has these bugs but please let me know if you want me to fix the bugs
