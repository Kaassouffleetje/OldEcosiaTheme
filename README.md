# OldEcosiaTheme

Userscript that reverts the new Ecosia theme
The code is still very bad, I just threw this together quickly because I can't stand the new design. Feel free to contribute!

Currently only works for the Search page (www.ecosia.org/search?q=[query])

Installation: Install the Tampermonkey add-on in your browser, then open the file ("raw" button)

I used https://web.archive.org/web/20210106110207/ecosia.org/search?q=dog to retrieve the SVG files and CSS parameters
